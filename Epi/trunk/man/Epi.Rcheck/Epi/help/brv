     The 'brv' data frame has 399 rows and 11 columns. The data concern
     the possible effect of marital bereavement on subsequent
     mortality. They arose from a survey of the physical and mental
     health of a cohort of 75-year-olds in one large general practice.
     These data concern mortality up to 1 January, 1990 (although
     further follow-up has now taken place).

     Subjects included all lived with a living spouse when they entered
     the study. There are three distinct groups of such subjects: (1)
     those in which both members of the couple were over 75 and
     therefore included in the cohort, (2) those whose spouse was below
     75 (and was not, therefore, part of the main cohort study), and
     (3) those living in larger households (that is, not just with
     their spouse).
