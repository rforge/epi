_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function cuts the follow-up time at a failure allowing a
     person to stay at risk after the failure. It is aimed at
     processing of recurrent events. Failure times outside the interval
     ('enter','exit') are ignored.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fcut1( enter, exit, fail, dof, fail.value = 1, 
              data = data.frame(enter, exit, fail, dof),
            Expand = 1:nrow(data) )

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   enter: Date of entry into the study. Numerical vector.

    exit: Date of exit from the study. Numerical vector.

    fail: Failure indicator for the exit date.

     dof: Date of failure. Numerical vector. Missing for persons who do
          not have an event.

fail.value: Value for failure indicator 'Fail' at the date 'dof'.

    data: Dataframe of variables to be carried unchanged to the output.

  Expand: Variable identifying original records.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A dataframe with the same columns as in 'data', preceded by the
     columns: 

  Expand: Identification of the rows from the input dataframe.

   Enter: Entry date for the interval.

    Exit: Exit date for the interval.

    Fail: Failure indicator for the interval.
