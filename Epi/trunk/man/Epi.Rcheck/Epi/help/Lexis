_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Create an object of class 'Lexis' to represent follow-up on
     multiple time scales.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     Lexis(entry, exit, duration, entry.status = 0, exit.status = 0, id, data,
           merge=TRUE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   entry: a named list of entry times. Each element of the list is a
          numeric variable representing the entry time on the named
          time scale. All time scales must have the same units (e.g.
          years)

    exit: a named list of exit times

duration: a numeric vector giving the duration of follow-up

entry.status: a vector giving the status at entry

exit.status: a vector giving status at exit. Any change in status
          during follow-up is assumed to take place exactly at the exit
          time

      id: a vector giving a unique identity value for each row of the
          Lexis object

    data: an optional data frame, list, or environment containing the
          variables. If  not found in 'data', the variables are taken
          from the environment from which 'Lexis' was called

   merge: a logical flag. If 'TRUE' then the 'data'  argument will be
          coerced to a data frame and then merged with the resulting
          'Lexis' object

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The analysis of long-term population-based follow-up studies
     typically requires multiple time scales to be taken into account,
     such as age, calender time, or time since an event. A 'Lexis'
     object is a data frame with additional attributes that allows
     these multiple time dimensions of follow-up to be managed.

     Lexis objects are named after the German gemographer Wilhelm Lexis
     (1837-1914), who is credited with the invention of the "Lexis
     diagram" for representing population dynamics simultaneously by
     age, period and cohort.

     The 'Lexis' function creates a minimal 'Lexis' object with only
     those variables required to define the follow-up history in each
     row. Additional variables can be merged into the 'Lexis' object
     using the 'merge' method for 'Lexis' objects.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     An object of class 'Lexis'. This is represented as a data frame
     with a column for each time scale, and additional columns with the
     following names: 

  lex.id: Identification of the inidvidual

lex.deltat: Duration of follow-up

lex.status1: Entry status

lex.status2: Exit status

     If 'merge=TRUE' then the 'Lexis' object will also contain all
     variables from the 'data' argument.

_N_o_t_e:

     Only two of the three arguments 'entry', 'exit' and 'duration'
     need to be given.  If the third parameter is missing, it is
     imputed. If duration is imputed, it must be the same on all time
     scales.
