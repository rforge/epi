_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Given the basic outcome variables for a cohort study: the time of
     entry  to the cohort, the time of exit and the reason for exit
     ("failure" or "censoring"), this function computes risk sets and
     generates a matched case-control study in which each case is
     compared with a set of controls randomly sampled from the
     appropriate risk set. Other variables may be matched when
     selecting controls.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ccwc(entry=0, exit, fail, origin=0, controls=1, match=list(), include=list(), data=NULL, silent=F)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   entry: Time of entry to follow-up 

    exit: Time of exit from follow-up 

    fail: Status on exit (1=Fail, 0=Censored) 

  origin: Origin of analysis time scale 

controls: The number of controls to be selected for each case 

   match: List of categorical variables on which to match cases and
          controls 

 include: List of other variables to be carried across into the
          case-control study 

    data: Data frame in which to look for input variables 

  silent: If  False, echos a . to the screen for each case-control set
          created; otherwise produces no output. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The case-control study, as a  dataframe containing: 

     Set: case-control set number 

     Map: row number of record in input dataframe 

    Time: failure time of the case in this set 

    Fail: failure status (1=case, 0=control) 

     These are followed by the matching variables, and finally by the
     variables in the 'include' list
