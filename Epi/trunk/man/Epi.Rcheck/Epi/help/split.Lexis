_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The 'splitLexis' function divides each row of a 'Lexis' object
     into disjoint follow-up intervals according to the supplied break
     points.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     splitLexis(lex, breaks)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     lex: an object of class 'Lexis'

  breaks: a named list of numeric vectors giving the break points on
          one or more time scales. Optionally, a single vector of break
          points may be given, in which case the first time scale is
          assumed. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     An object of class 'Lexis' with multiple rows for each row of the
     argument 'lex'. Each row of the new 'Lexis' object contains the
     part of the follow-up interval that falls inside one of the time
     bands defined by the break points.

     The variables representing the various time scales, are
     appropriately updated in the new 'Lexis' object. The entry and
     exit status variables are also updated according to the rule that
     the entry status is retained until the end of follow-up. All other
     variables are considered to represent variables that are constant
     in time, and so are replicated across all rows having the same id
     value.
