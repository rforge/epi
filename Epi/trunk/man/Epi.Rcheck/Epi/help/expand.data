     This is a utility function.

     The original records with 'first.well', 'last.well' and
     'first.ill' are expanded to multiple records; several for each
     interval where the person is known to be well and one where the
     person is known to fail. At the same time columns for the
     covariates needed to estimate rates and the response variable are
     generated.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      fu: A 3-column matrix with 'first.well', 'last.well' and
          'first.ill' in each row.

 formula: Model fromula, used to derive the model matrix.

  breaks: Defines the intervals in which the baseline rate is assumed
          constant. All follow-up before the first and after the last
          break is discarded.

    data: Datafrem in which 'fu' and 'formula' is interpreted.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Returns a list with three components 

rates.frame: Dataframe of covariates for estimation of the baseline
          rates - one per interval defined by 'breaks'.

cov.frame: Dataframe for estimation of the covariate effects. A
          data-framed version of the designmatrix from 'formula'.

       y: Response vector.
