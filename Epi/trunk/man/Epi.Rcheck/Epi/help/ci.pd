_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The usual formula for the c.i. of at difference of proportions is
     inaccurate. Newcombe has compared 11 methods and method 10 in his
     paper looks like a winner. It is implemented here.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ci.pd(aa, bb=NULL, cc=NULL, dd=NULL,
          method = "Nc",
           alpha = 0.05, conf.level=0.95,
          digits = 3,
           print = TRUE,
     detail.labs = FALSE )

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

      aa: Numeric vector of successes in sample 1. Can also be a matrix
          or array (see details).

      bb: Successes in sample 2.

      cc: Failures in sample 1.

      dd: Failures in sample 2.

  method: Method to use for calculation of confidence interval, see
          "Details".

   alpha: Significance level

conf.level: Confidence level

   print: Should an account of the two by two table be printed.

  digits: How many digits should the result be rounded to if printed.

detail.labs: Should the computing of probability differences be
          reported in the labels.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Implements method 10 from Newcombe(1998) (method="Nc") or from
     Agresti & Caffo(2000) (method="AC").

     'aa', 'bb', 'cc' and 'dd' can be vectors. If 'aa' is a matrix, the
     elements '[1:2,1:2]' are used, with successes 'aa[,1:2]'. If 'aa'
     is a three-way table or array, the elements 'aa[1:2,1:2,]' are
     used.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix with three columns: probability difference, lower and
     upper limit. The number of rows equals the length of the vectors 
     'aa', 'bb', 'cc' and 'dd' or, if 'aa' is a 3-way matrix,
     'dim(aa)[3]'.
