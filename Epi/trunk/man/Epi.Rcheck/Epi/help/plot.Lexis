     The follow-up histories represented by a Lexis object can be
     plotted using one or two dimensions.  The two dimensional plot is
     a Lexis diagram showing follow-up time simultaneously on two time
     scales.

     ## S3 method for class 'Lexis':
     plot(x, time.scale = NULL, breaks="lightgray", ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'Lexis':
     points(x, time.scale = NULL, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: An object of class 'Lexis'

time.scale: A vector of length 1 or 2 giving the time scales to be
          plotted either by name or numerical order

  breaks: a string giving the colour of grid lines to be drawn when
          plotting a split Lexis object. Grid lines can be suppressed
          by supplying the value 'NULL' to the 'breaks' argument

     ...: Further graphical parameters to be passed to the plotting
          methods. Grids can be drawn using the followin parameters in
          'plot':

             *  'grid' If logical, a background grid is set up using
                the axis ticks. If a list, the first component is used
                as positions for the vertical lines and the last as
                positions for the horizontal. If a nunerical vector,
                grids on both axes are set up using the distance
                between the numbers.

             *  'col.grid="lightgray"' Color of the background grid.

             *  'lty.grid=2' Line type for the grid.

             *  'coh.grid=FALSE' Should a 45 degree grid be plotted?

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The plot method for 'Lexis' objects traces ``life lines'' from the
     start to the end of follow-up.  The 'points' method plots points
     at the end of the life lines.

     If 'time.scale' is of length 1, the life lines are drawn
     horizontally, with the time scale on the X axis and the id value
     on the Y axis. If 'time.scale' is of length 2, a Lexis diagram is
     produced, with diagonal life lines plotted against both time
     scales simultaneously.

     If 'lex' has been split along one of the time axes by a call to
     'splitLexis', then vertical or horizontal grid lines are plotted
     at the break points.
