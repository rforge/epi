_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Male lung cancer cases and population riks time in Denmark, for
     the period 1943-1992 in ages 40-89.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     data(lungDK)

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     A data frame with 220 observations on the following 9 variables.

       'A5':  Left end point of the age interval, a numeric vector.
       'P5':  Left enpoint of the period interval, a numeric vector.
       'C5':  Left enpoint of the birth cohort interval, a numeric vector.
       'up':  Indicator of upper trianges of each age by period rectangle in the Lexis diagram. ('up=(P5-A5-C5)/5').
       'Ax':  The mean age of diagnois (at risk) in the triangle.
       'Px':  The mean date of diagnosis (at risk) in the triangle.
       'Cx':  The mean date of birth in the triangle, a numeric vector.
        'D':  Number of diagnosed cases of male lung cancer.
        'Y':  Risk time in the male population, person-years.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Cases and person-years are tabulated by age and date of diagnosis
     (period) as well as date of birth (cohort) in 5-year classes. Each
     observation in the dataframe correponds to a triangle in a Lexis
     diagram. Triangles are classified by age and date of diagnosis,
     period of diagnosis and date of birth, all in 5-year groupings.

_S_o_u_r_c_e:

     The Danish Cancer Registry and Statistics Denmark.
