_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     age: Numerical vector of length 2, giving the age-range for the
          diagram

    alab: Label on the age-axis.

    date: Numerical vector of length 2, giving the calendar time-range
          for the diagram

    dlab: label on the calendar time axis.

     int: The interval between grid lines in the diagram. If a vector
          of length two is given, the first value will be used for
          spacing of age-grid and the second for spacing of the date
          grid.

 lab.int: The interval between labelling of the grids.

col.life: Colour of the life lines.

lwd.life: Width of the life lines.

age.grid: Should grid lines be drawn for age?

date.grid: Should grid lines be drawn for date?

coh.grid: Should grid lines be drawn for birth cohorts (diagonals)?

col.grid: Colour of the grid lines.

lwd.grid: Width of the grid lines.

     las: How are the axis labels plotted?

entry.date, entry.age, exit.date, exit.age, risk.time,
birth.date: Nume
          rical vectors defining lifelines to be plotted in the
          diagram. At least three must be given to produce lines. Not
          all subsets of three will suffice, the given subset has to 
          define life lines. If insufficient data is given, no life
          lines are produced.

    fail: Logical of event status at exit for the persons whose  life
          lines are plotted.

pch.fail: Symbols at the end of the life lines for censorings
          ('fail'=0) and failures ('fail'$\ne$0).

cex.fail: Expansion of the status marks at the end of life lines.

col.fail: Character vector of length 2 giving the colour of the failure
          marks for censorings and failures respectively.

    data: Dataframe in which to interpret the arguments.

     ...: Arguments to be passed on to the initial call to plot.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The default unit for supplied variables are (calendar) years. If
     any of the variables 'entry.date', 'exit.date' or 'birth.date' are
     of class "'Date'" or if any of the variables 'entry.age',
     'exit.age' or 'risk.time' are of class "'difftime'", they will be
     converted to calendar years, and plotted correctly in the diagram.
     The returned dataframe will then have colums of classes "'Date'"
     and  "'difftime'".

_V_a_l_u_e:

     If sufficient information on lifelines is given, a data frame with
     one row per person and columns with entry ages and dates, birth
     date, risk time and status filled in.

     Side effect: a plot of a Lexis diagram is produced with the life
     lines in it is produced. This will be the main reason for using
     the function.
