_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The break points of a 'Lexis' object (created by a call to
     'splitLexis') divide the follow-up intervals into time bands along
     a given time scale. The 'breaks' function returns the break
     points, for a given time scale, and the 'timeBand' classifies each
     row into one of the time bands.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     timeBand(lex, time.scale, type)
     breaks(lex, time.scale)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     lex: an object of class 'Lexis'

time.scale: a character or integer vector of length 1 identifying the
          time scale of interest

    type: a string that determines how the time bands are labelled. See
          Details below

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Time bands may be labelled in various ways according to the 'type'
     argument. The permitted values of the 'type' argument, and the
     corresponding return values are:

"_f_a_c_t_o_r" a factor (unordered) with labels "(left,right]"

"_i_n_t_e_g_e_r" a numeric vector with integer codes starting from 0

"_l_e_f_t" the left-hand limit of the time band

"_m_i_d_d_l_e" the middle of the time band

"_r_i_g_h_t" the right-hand limit of the time band

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The 'breaks' function returns a vector of break points for the
     'Lexis' object, or NULL if no break points have been defined by a
     call to 'splitLexis'.  The 'timeBand' function returns a numeric
     vector or factor, depending on the value of the 'type' argument.

_N_o_t_e:

     A newly created 'Lexis' object has no break points defined. In
     this case, 'breaks' will return NULL, and 'timeBand' will return a
     degenerate factor with one level labelled "(-Inf,Inf]".
