_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Projects the columns of the matrix 'M' on the space spanned by the
     columns of the matrix 'X', with respect to the inner product
     defined by 'weight': '<x|y>=sum(x*w*y)'.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     projection.ip(X, M, orth = FALSE, weight = rep(1, nrow(X)))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       X: Matrix defining the space to project onto. 

       M: Matrix of columns to be projected. Must have the same number
          of rows as 'X'. 

    orth: Should the projection be on the orthogonal complement to
          'span(X)'? 

  weight: Weights defining the inner product. Numerical vector of
          length 'nrow(X)'. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix of full rank with columns in 'span(X)'.
