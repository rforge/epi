_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The 'diet' data frame has 337 rows and 14 columns. The data
     concern a subsample of subjects drawn from larger cohort studies
     of the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD). These subjects
     had all completed a 7-day weighed dietary survey while taking part
     in validation studies of dietary questionnaire methods. Upon the
     closure of the MRC Social Medicine Unit, from where these studies
     were directed, it was found that 46 CHD events had occurred in
     this group, thus allowing a serendipitous study of the
     relationship between diet and the incidence of CHD.

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

     This data frame contains the following columns:

               'id':  subject identifier, a numeric vector.
              'doe':  date of entry into follow-up study, a 'Date' variable.
              'dox':  date of exit from the follow-up study, a 'Date' variable.
              'dob':  date of birth, a 'Date' variable.
                'y':  - number of years at risk, a numeric vector.
             'fail':  status on exit, a numeric vector (codes 1, 3, 11, and 13 represent CHD events)
              'job':  occupation, a factor with levels 'Driver'  'Conductor'  'Bank worker'
            'month':  month of dietary survey, a numeric vector
           'energy':  total energy intake (KCal per day/100), a numeric vector
           'height':  (cm), a numeric vector
           'weight':  (kg), a numeric vector
              'fat':  fat intake (g/day), a numeric vector
            'fibre':  dietary fibre intake (g/day), a numeric vector
       'energy.grp':  high daily energy intake, a factor with levels '<=2750 KCal' '>2750 KCal'
              'chd':  CHD event, a numeric vector (1=CHD event, 0=no event)

     The data are described and used extensively by Clayton and Hills,
     Statistical Models in Epidemiology, Oxford University Press,
     Oxford:1993. They were rescued from destruction by David Clayton
     and reentered from paper printouts.
