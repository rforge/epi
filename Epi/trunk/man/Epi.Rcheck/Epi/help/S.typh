_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     In the fall of 1996 an unusually large number of Salmonella
     Typhimurium cases were recorded in Fyn county in Denmark. The
     Danish Zoonosis Centre set up a matched case-control study to find
     the sources. Cases and two age-, sex- and residency-matched
     controls were telephone interviewed about their food intake during
     the last two weeks.

     The participants were asked at which retailer(s) they had
     purchased meat. Retailers were independently of this linked to
     meat processing plants, and thus participants were linked to meat
     processing plants. This way persons could be linked to (amongst
     other) plant no 7.
