     Fits the classical five models to tabulated rate data (cases,
     person-years) classified by two of age, period, cohort: Age,
     Age-drift, Age-Period, Age-Cohort and Age-period. There are no
     assumtions about the age, period or cohort classes being of the
     same length, or that tabulation should be only by two of the
     variables. Only requires that mean age and period for each
     tabulation unit is given.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    data: Data frame with (at least) variables, 'A' (age), 'P'
          (period), 'D' (cases, deaths) and 'Y' (person-years). Cohort
          (date of birth) is computed as 'P-A'.

       A: Age; numerical vector with mean age at diagnosis for each
          unit.

       P: Period; numerical vector with mean date of diagnosis for each
          unit.

       D: Cases, deaths; numerical vector.

       Y: Person-years; numerical vector.

   ref.c: Reference cohort, numerical. Defaults to median date of birth
          among cases. If used with 'parm="AdCP"' or 'parm="AdPC"', the
          resdiual cohort effects will be 1 at ref.c

   ref.p: reference period, numerical. Defaults to median date of
          diagnosis among cases.

   model: Type of model fitted:

             *  'bs' fits a model with B-splines for each of the terms,
                with 'npar' parameters for the terms.

             *  'ns' fits a model with natural splines for each of the
                terms, with 'npar' parameters for the terms.

             *  'ls' fits a model with linear splines.

             *  'factor' fits a factor model with one parameter per
                value of 'A', 'P' and 'C'. 'npar' is ignored in this
                case. .in -3 

 dr.extr: How the drift parameter should be extracted from the
          age-period-cohort model. 'weighted' (default) lets the
          weighted average (by marginal no. cases, 'D') of the
          estimated period and cohort effects have 0 slopw. 'Holford'
          uses the naïve average over all values for the estimated
          effects, disregarding the no. cases.

    parm: The parametrization of the effects. The first four all refer
          to the ML-fit of the Age-Period-Cohort model, the last four
          give Age-effects from a smaller model and residuals relative
          to this. If one of the latter is chosen, 'drift' is ignored. 
          Possible values are:

             *  'ACP': ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
                reference cohort. Cohort effects as RR relative to the
                reference cohort. Period effects constrained to be 0 on
                average with 0 slope.

             *  'APC': ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
                reference period. Period effects as RR relative to the
                reference period. Cohort effects constrained to be 0 on
                average with 0 slope.

             *  'AdCP': ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
                reference cohort. Cohort and period effects constrained
                to be 0 on average with 0 slope. These effects do not
                multiply to the fitted rates, the drift is missing and
                needs to be included to produce the fitted values.

             *  'AdPC': ML-estimates. Age-effects as rates for the
                reference period. Cohort and period effects constrained
                to be 0 on average with 0 slope. These effects do not
                multiply to the fitted rates, the drift is missing and
                needs to be included to produce the fitted values.

             *  'Ad-C-P': Age effects are rates for the reference
                cohort in the Age-drift model (cohort drift). Cohort
                effects are from the model with cohort alone, using
                log(fitted values) from the Age-drift model as offset.
                Period effects are from the model with period alone
                using log(fitted values) from the cohort model as
                offset.      

             *  'Ad-P-C': Age effects are rates for the reference
                period in the Age-drift model (period drift). Period
                effects are from the model with period alone, using
                log(fitted values) from the Age-drift model as offset.
                Cohort effects are from the model with cohort alone
                using log(fitted values) from the period model as
                offset.      

             *  'AC-P': Age effects are rates for the reference cohort
                in the Age-Cohort model, cohort effects are RR relative
                to the reference cohort. Period effects are from the
                model with period alone, using log(fitted values) from
                the Age-Cohort model as offset.

             *  'AP-C': Age effects are rates for the reference period
                in the Age-Period model, period effects are RR relative
                to the reference period. Cohort effects are from the
                model with cohort alone, using log(fitted values) from
                the Age-Period model as offset.

    npar: The number of parameters to use for each of the terms in the
          model. It can be a list of three numerical vectors, in which
          case these taken as the knots for the age, period and cohort
          effect, the first and last element in each vector are used as
          the boundary knots.

   alpha: The significance level. Estimates are given with (1-'alpha')
          confidence limits.

   scale: numeric(1), factor multiplied to the rate estimates before
          output.

print.AOV: Should the analysis of deviance table for the models be
          printed?

_V_a_l_u_e:

     An object of class "apc" (recognized by 'apc.lines' and
     'apc.plot') - a list with components: 

     Age: Matrix with 4 colums: 'A.pt' with the ages (equals
          'unique(A)') and three columns giving the estimated rates
          with c.i.s.

     Per: Matrix with 4 colums: 'P.pt' with the dates of diagnosis
          (equals 'unique(P)') and three columns giving the estimated
          RRs with c.i.s.

     Coh: Matrix with 4 colums: 'C.pt' with the dates of birth (equals
          'unique(P-A)') and three columns giving the estimated RRs
          with c.i.s.

   Drift: A 3 column matrix with drift-estimates and c.i.s: The first
          row is the ML-estimate of the drift (as defined by 'drift'),
          the second row is the estimate from the Age-drift model. For
          the sequential parametrizations, only the latter is given.

     Ref: Numerical vector of length 2 with reference period and
          cohort. If ref.p or ref.c was not supplied the corresponding
          element is NA.

     AOV: Analysis of deviance table comparing the five classical
          models.

    Type: Character string explaining the model and the
          parametrization.

   Knots: If 'model' is one of '"ns"' or '"bs"', a list with three
          components: 'Age', 'Per', 'Coh', each one a vector of knots.
          The max and the min are the boundary knots.

  Powers: If 'model' is '"fpol"', a list with three components: 'Age',
          'Per', 'Coh', each one a vector of the powers used in the
          fractional polynomials.
