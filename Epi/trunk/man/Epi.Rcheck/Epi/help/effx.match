_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The function calculates the effects of an exposure on a response,
     possibly stratified by a stratifying variable, and/or controlled
     for one of more confounding variables.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     effx.match(response,
     exposure,
     match,
     strata=NULL,
     control=NULL,
     base=1,
     sigdig=3,
     alpha=0.05,
     data=NULL) 

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

response: The 'response' variable - must be numeric

exposure: The 'exposure' variable can be numeric or a factor

   match: The variable which identifies the matched sets

  strata: The 'strata' stratifying variable - must be a factor

 control: The 'control' variable(s). These are passed as a list if
          there are more than one of them.

    base: Baseline for the effects of a categorical exposure, default 1

  sigdig: Number of significant digits for the effects, default 3

   alpha: 1 - confidence level

    data: 'data' refers to the data used to evaluate the function

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Effects are calculated odds ratios. The function is a wrapper for
     clogit, from the survival package. The k-1 effects for a
     categorical  exposure with k levels are relative  to a baseline
     which, by default, is the first level. The effect of a metric
     (quantitative)  exposure is calculated per unit of exposure. The
     exposure variable can be numeric or a factor, but if it is an
     ordered factor the order will be ignored.

_V_a_l_u_e:

  comp1 : Effects of exposure

  comp2 : Tests of significance

_W_a_r_n_i_n_g:

     The function attaches the frame specified in the 'data=' argument,
     so there is a possibility that a variable in the Global
     environment is masked by the attached frame. Watch out for this
     warning in the output!
